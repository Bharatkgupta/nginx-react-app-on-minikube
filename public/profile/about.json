    "about": "I'm passionate about writing code, solving problems, automating stuff, and building software. I have 2-month internship experience at amazon in a software development role. During my internship at Amazon, I gained hands-on experience working on real-life projects, collaborating with team members, and learning and applying new technologies & skills. I have also worked on various projects related to the software domain during my studies. \n Apart from coding and academics, I love reading novels and watching movies & anime to release buildup pressure. I occasionally do some social welfare work as a member of Avana, a social welfare club. I think of myself as a problem-solver, and I love solving new problems.",
